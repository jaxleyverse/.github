## Jaxleyverse: Differentiable neuron simulations on CPU, GPU, or TPU

The `Jaxleyverse` contains code for differentiable neuron simulations in Python.

The center of the `Jaxleyverse` is the [`Jaxley` simulator](https://github.com/jaxleyverse/jaxley). `Jaxley` allows to simulate biophysically detailed neuron models on CPU, GPU, or TPU. In addition, it can compute gradients with respect to parameters such as ion channel or synaptic parameters. The `Jaxleyverse` also contains [`jaxley-mech`](https://github.com/jaxleyverse/jaxley-mech), which is a collection of ion channels and synapses.
